## 1. Positioning

### 1.1 Problem statement
There is the common phenomenon that most of people think programming is hard and boring to learn. In addition, the lack of engagemment from learning programming affects beginner programmers and non-programmers. All of factors make people lose interest or have no interest in programming.

### 1.2 Product Position Statement
For beginner programmers and non-programmers who are not interested in learning programming, CS-Play is an interactive learning platform that teaches programming with puzzles and games, unlike traditional teaching methods in the classroom or by the video guidance, which have little to no interactivity. Our product allows users to "write code" immediately by playing games that are more like adventures with guidance and direct results(grades and feedback). The users also can share their works in our community so that they could learn from each other, which everybody is taking part in wins.

### 1.3 Value proposition and customer segment
