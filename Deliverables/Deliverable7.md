## 1. Description
For beginners who are interested in learning programming, CS-Play is an interactive platform that teaches programming with puzzles and games. Unlike traditional teaching methods in class and video tutorials, which have little to no interactivity, our product allows users to “write code” immediately by playing games that are more like adventures. We want our users to be able to create their own account and in the future to even play levels created by other users.
