For web hosting, we used AWS. AWS has a good performance in scalability because it provides us with an easy option to upgrade to a better plan. And we will use Django as our web framework because Django can go well with python and it supports all the libraries that are supported by python programs. Also, Django is a relatively secure web framework. And we will use mySQL as our database management system.
