The website consists of a front-end to handle most of the visible parts, a back-end to handle client-server interaction and the code for the levels/games. The front-end can be divided into categories like startpage, login and account. We designed it like this so that each part would be clearly defined and separated from the rest. This way the developers can focus on one part at a time.
