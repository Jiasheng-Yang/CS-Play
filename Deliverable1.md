# Deliverable 1 - Inception

*Group 5 - “CS Play”*   
*Date:* 19 September, 2021  
*Group members: Aidan Sullivan, Emma Carlsson, Johnathan Ray, Vincent Machado, Jiasheng Yang, Pengfei Liu*  

## 1. Introduction  
We are creating a game that teaches programming by making the player solve game levels using different programming concepts such as loops, if-conditions and similar. We think that by making it into a game the content of programming will be more digestible. Many current ways of learning programming involves reading long walls of text or choosing among thousands of better or worse video tutorials. That's why we want to make the process simpler by offering a site that teaches using more interactive and fun methods. We belive that beginner programmers and younger people have an interest in games and would therefore enjoy learning programming on a site with game elements.

## 3. Interviews summary

### Interview 1
**Summary:** 
Has around 5 years experience with programming and mostly learned from courses in school. He would have liked more more guidance and help as a beginner. Also likes video tutorials, to see someone else do it and then try yourself. Learning with a game would be more fun because you get to really see what your code does. He has a lot of experience with games (For example multiplayer FPS, RPG and sandbox) and thinks it would be more fun with violent video games than non-violent. He would prefer a website as platform over an app because that makes it easier to access, especially on computer.
