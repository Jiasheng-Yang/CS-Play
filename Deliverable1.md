# Deliverable 1 - Inception

*Group 5 - “CS Play”*   
*Date:* 19 September, 2021
*Group members: Aidan Sullivan, Emma Carlsson, Johnathan Ray, Vincent Machado, Jiasheng Yang, Pengfei Liu*  

## 1. Introduction  
We are creating a game that teaches programming by making the player solve game levels using different programming concepts such as loops, if-conditions and similar. We think that by making it into a game the content of programming will be more digestible. Many current ways of learning programming involves reading long walls of text or choosing among thousands of better or worse video tutorials. That's why we want to make the process simpler by offering a site that teaches using more interactive and fun methods. We belive that beginner programmers and younger people have an interest in games and would therefore enjoy learning programming on a site with game elements.

## 3. Interviews summary

### Interview 1
**Summary:**
Has around 5 years experience with programming and mostly learned from courses in school. He would have liked more more guidance and help as a beginner. Also likes video tutorials, to see someone else do it and then try yourself. Learning with a game would be more fun because you get to really see what your code does. He has a lot of experience with games (For example multiplayer FPS, RPG and sandbox) and thinks it would be more fun with violent video games than non-violent. He would prefer a website as platform over an app because that makes it easier to access, especially on computer.

### Interview 2
**Summary:**
Has around 3 years of experience with programming. Mostly learned from courses in school. Didn't really like that because she had som bad teachers. She likes the idea of learning with games and thinks that you should be able to cheat. She has a lot of earlier experience with games. She would like the platform to be a website for easier access. Any kind of game levels as long as it clearly illustrates the concept.

### Interview 3
**Summary:** Couple months of programming experience. Mostly watched teacher do something and copied him. Didn't like how limited it was; she was only able to do 1-2 things. Also didn't like how long it took to learn. She is very much a visual learner and thinks of images when she is trying to memorize something. She has learned using games in the past and says that she "might want" a game like the one we are trying to build. In particular, she likes arcade-type games and games where you can make your own stuff.

### Interview 4
**Summary:** Has about 2 1/2 experience using early prgramming languages (i.e. QBasic, Fortran, Pascal) and early C++. Took programming classes in college (lecture classes). Did not like lack of guidance, enjoyed when program worked. She likes learning in an in-person classroom environment that doesn't rush her. Appreciates watching a person doing something and asking questions along the way. She likes the idea of our game and says that she "wants it". Wants the game to involve quick learning.

**Interviewee:** Leressa Ray  
**Date:** 18 September 2021   
**Interview method:** In-person interview   
**Consumer segment:** Beginner programmer
**Key insights:**
* Game should be able to show and tell the player about the topics it delves into
* When playing, it should be easier to get better at the game

**Representative quotes:**
* "Don't just tell me how something works. Show and tell me."
* "I want to be able to do better easier"

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care**
* Show and tell the player what the concepts entail (Must have)
* Game elements (Must have)
* Ability to easily do better (Must have)



### Interview 5
**Summary:** Interviewee has about 4 years of coding experience, has knowledge in C++, Python, Java, Html, and CSS. Currently in college and is still taking coding courses. Usually learns from online video tutorials and websites. Thinks that these learning platforms contain more information, but mostly lack engagement. Enjoys making personal challenges while learning a topic, and says that is when he learns the most. Says that a website is the most useful platform for our software. Has experience playing games, usually strategy games, and thinks that this genre would be a good learning device. Overall consensus is that the idea has some good features, but it might be useful to have a mix between mini-games and learning for it to be really useful.
**Interviewer:** Aidan Sullivan
**Interviewee:** Miles Brown
**Date:** 17 September 2021
**Interview Method:** In-person
**Consumer Segment:** 20 years old, still learning programming
**Key Insights:**
* There should be a variety of methods of learning, not just mini-games
* Difficulty should increase drastically near the end, in order to have a better challenge

**Representative Quotes:**
* "I learn the most when I am doing long-term, complicating projects rather than shorter challenges"

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don't care**
* Mini-Games (Nice to have)
* Challenges / Scaling Difficulty (Must have)
* Website (Must have)



### Interview 6
**Summary:** Interviewee has limited programming experience, mainly in c with OS. Is currently attending college, which is where most of their programming experience comes from. Doesn't particularly enjoy learning on his own, instead learns more from a classroom experience. Thinks our idea is useful, but not something that they would use regularly, unless it was required to use for school. Has a lot of experience playing games, usually FPS, RPG, and multiplayer games. Thinks that the games should be difficult, but still offer a bit of help if needed.
