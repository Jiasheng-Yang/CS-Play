Also likes video tutorials, to see someone else do it and then try yourself. Learning with a game would be more fun because you get to really see what your code does. He has a lot of experience with games (For example multiplayer FPS, RPG and sandbox) and thinks it would be more fun with violent video games than non-violent. He would prefer a website as platform over an app because that makes it easier to access, especially on computer.
